## Snake Learning Game
# This is an example project

This is a project that I will be using to help familiarize myself with the lessons
taught in class. This is open source, and anyone is allowed to clone the repo. You could
even submit PRs if they are within the scope of the project.

You should have pygame installed to run this. 
Simply google how to install pygame if you find yourself needing it.

Below you will find a list of objectives to accomplish, 
this should be an ever updating list as the project moves on.

# TODO List
1. Make Obstacles that can be placed around the map randomly
2. Keep track of the highest score ever from the local machine
3. Add more types of "food" that can be ate by the snake
   1. Bonus to length (+2?)
   2. Reduction to length (-1?)
      1. Would need to make sure you can't go past the length of 1
