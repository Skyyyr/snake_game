## Snake Learning Game
# This is an example project

This is a project that I will be using to help familiarize myself with the lessons
taught in class. This is open source, and anyone is allowed to clone the repo. You could
even submit PRs if they are within the scope of the project.

You should have pygame installed to run this. 
Simply google how to install pygame if you find yourself needing it.

Below you will find a list of objectives to accomplish, 
this should be an ever updating list as the project moves on.
